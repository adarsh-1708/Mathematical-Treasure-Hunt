        <p class="text-small">CARL FRIEDRICH GAUSS was a German Mathematician born on 30th April 1777 in Brunswick.He has significant contributions to many fields including number theory, algebra, statistics, astronomy, geophysics and other more. In 1788 Gauss began his education
            at the Gymnasium with the help of Buttner and Bartels, where he learnt High German and Latin. Then he entered Brunswick Collegium Carolium and left it to study at Gottingen University. In 1799 he received a degree in Brunswick. In school,
            once his teacher gave a problem of summation of the integers from 1 to 100 (an arithmetic series) to keep students busy. Gauss solved this problem quickly which shocked the class , he solved this problem by all the 8 methods it can be solved.
            On 23 February 1855, Gauss died of a heart attack in Göttingen.
