                    Leonhard Euler was born in a priest family on 15th April 1707, in Basel Switzerland, Bernoulli was a great mathematician of that time and also a kind friend of Euler’s father. Euler was deeply interested and Excellent in many fields of Mathematics. Bernoulli
                    Suggested Euler to invest his time and knowledge in Mathematics rather than being a priest. During his teens, he earned a masters from Basel University. He started growing rapidly in the field of Maths under the guidance of Bernoulli,
                    In 1738 he lost his one eye and in 1766 he became completely blind. After this he started publishing 1 paper every week from 1766 to 1775. His research Shocked the Mathematics world and he replied that after being blind he was less
                    distracted and managed to think better . If all the research of Euler was put together a book of 30,000 pages would be published. He invested his whole life doing mathematics and died peacefully on 18th sep 1783.
