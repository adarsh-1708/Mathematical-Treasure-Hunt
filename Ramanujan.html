            his studies. He worked as a clerk and during this time he kept on working on Mathematics. He impressed G.H Hardy by his research work and Hardy called him to Cambridge University to work along. G.H hardy was Ramanujan’s Mentor and a good friend
            for many years. Ramanujan solved many unsolved problems in less time but he could not publish it just because he couldn't give an explanation about the answer, when countered this situation he replied that many of his answers were gifted by
            his Goddess (Nama Devi). Ramanujan was suffering from Tuberculosis and the weather condition of London was not suitable to him so he decided to return back to India. He died suffering from TB on April 26, 1920 in an young age of 32 years.
